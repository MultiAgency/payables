 * The unattended-run report: what the treasury agent's scheduler recorded tick by tick (src/evidence.ts),

 * signed-in account in REPORT_COOKIE_FILE (a file holding `dao_session=…`, never pasted anywhere).
 *
 *   DASHBOARD_URL=https://… REPORT_COOKIE_FILE=… SINCE=2026-…Z [UNTIL=…Z] [OUT=report.md] pnpm run-report

 * It reports operation only: one day of ticks says nothing about atomic budgets, strict caps or savings.
